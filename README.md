# Poker Simulations

Poker Game with Monte Carlo Simulations
This Python project is a poker game designed to help new players understand their odds of winning at a table with up to 8 opponents. The program provides a command-line interface where players can:

Deal hands to themselves and opponents.
Simulate win and tie probabilities using Monte Carlo simulations, offering practical insights into decision-making during gameplay.
Key features include:

Custom Poker Logic: Card and hand evaluation using poker rules.
Dynamic Deck Management: Ensures accurate card dealing and reshuffling for simulations.
Scalable Simulations: Configurable for different numbers of opponents and iterations.
Command-Line Interface: Intuitive user input and clear output for easy interaction.
